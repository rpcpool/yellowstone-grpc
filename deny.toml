    # borsh 0.9.3
    # Advisory: https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0033
    # Affected versions of borsh cause undefined behavior when zero-sized-types (ZST) 
    # are parsed and the Copy/Clone traits are not implemented/derived.
    # For instance if 1000 instances of a ZST are deserialized, and the ZST is not copy 
    # (this can be achieved through a singleton), then accessing/writing to deserialized 
    # data will cause a segmentation fault.
